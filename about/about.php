                        I'm Clement and I'm a very avid pilot, photographer and software developer.<br /><br />
                        I have been interested in photography for many years, having first got the bug when I started using my dad's film SLR and haven't looked back since.<br />
                        I now have a large collection of cameras and equipment along with far too many photos to keep track of!<br /><br />
                        I started flying at the London Gliding Club in March 2013 and I now have over 70 flying hours and fly an ASW19b, <a href="http://lgccadets.co.uk/asw19/" target="_blank">G-DHCV</a>.<br /><br />
                        Right from the beginning I filmed my flights and put them on YouTube, with good success.<br /><br />
                        My best video so far has to be when the aerobatic pilot Guy Westgate came to our club and I filmed his evening display with fireworks on his glider.<br />
                        This video has now had over 60,000 views, has been featured as GoPro's international <a href="http://gopro.com/videos/video-of-the-day/2014/9/18/" target="_blank">video of the day</a>
                        and uploaded on Jukin Video's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JukinVideoDotCom/" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.<br /><br />
                        My day job is a software developer for Accenture in London.    I'm currently on a project at the BBC in White City.
